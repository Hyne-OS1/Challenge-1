# Horiseon Website

## Description

* My initial motivation for this project was to create a more user friendly code base for both CSS and HTML aspects.

* My building of this project was to create a website that outlined 3 sections of creating a succesful online business, those aspects being "Search Engine Optimization", "Online Reputation Management" and "Social Media Marketing" each one detailing the benefits to having these 3 elements.

* Creating a more user friendly code base allows for users to view the HTML and CSS source code in inspect element in a clean and more organised format which in turn makes the building and layout of the website more comprehensible for those wishing to learn said coding formats.

* Taking on this project taught me more effective ways of managing and rearagging code aswell as improving my overall ability and understanding of said code through reverse engineering and code layout.

## Usage

Using the website is quite user friendly and straight forward. Hyper links in your navigation menu will take you to each area of the website and provide a brief summary about what each topic is about. Right mouse button + click  anywhere on the site and using your inspect element in the drop down menu will also allow you to view the sites code and layout should you wish to look at the structure and layout of both the CSS and HTML code for further understanding and future reference application.
